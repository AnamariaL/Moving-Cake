# Moving-Cake-Towers-of-Hanoi-
The Red Emperor has ordered for the wedding of his son a cake win N stories. His cooks have set up the cake on a silver plate. However, the emperor wants the cake to be place on a golden plate. Unfortunately, the cooks have no idea how to move the cake from one plate to another, due to the immensity of the cake. However, they have figured out that only one additional plate can be used, a bronze plate. Write an application that will solve the cooksâ€™ dilemma and reconstruct the cake exactly as it was in the begging, but on the golden plate. The application should implement two different algorithms to solve the dilemma.
